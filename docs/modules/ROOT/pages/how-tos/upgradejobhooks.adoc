= UpgradeJobHook examples

This is a collection of upgradejobhooks for frequently used one-off tasks.

== Scale down a machineset

Scale down a machineset to remove a node after upgradejob is finished.
Disables ArgoCD auto-sync for the `root` and `openshift4-nodes` apps.
Only runs once on the next UpgradeJob due to the `.spec.run: Next` setting.
A clusterrolebinding for cluster-admin for the appuio-openshift-upgrade-controller default serviceaccount is included below.
